Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

I'd like to introduce you to a unique twist on the classic 'Vanishing Object' trick, which I'll call 'The Floating Message.' 

**Materials:**

1. A small, empty glass jar or container with a lid (about 2-3 inches in height)
2. A piece of paper or a small card with a message written on it (e.g., a name, a date, or a short phrase)
3. A small, thin piece of string or a length of cotton thread
4. A small, lightweight object (e.g., a small pebble, a button, or a small bead)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Begin by asking a spectator to write a message on the piece of paper or card. This could be their name, a special date, or a favorite phrase.
2. Next, ask the spectator to place the paper or card inside the glass jar, ensuring it's fully enclosed.
3. Tie the string or thread around the lid of the jar, securing it in place. This will create a 'locked' effect.
4. Now, ask the spectator to place the lightweight object (the pebble, button, or bead) on top of the jar, ensuring it's centered.
