Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: 'Floating Fruit'**

**Materials:**

1. 3 empty plastic cups (or glasses)
2. 1 small, lightweight object (e.g., a ping-pong ball, a small rubber ball, or a small stone)
3. 1 piece of fruit (e.g., an apple, an orange, or a small melon)
4. A table or other flat surface

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Place the small object (ping-pong ball, etc.) inside one of the cups. This will create a hidden compartment.
2. **Setup:** Place the other two cups on the table, side by side, with the cup containing the small object in the middle.
3. **Performance:** Hold the cup with the small object in your hand, and place the piece of fruit on top of the two empty cups.
4. **The Magic:** Slowly lift the cup with the small object, and as you do, make a gentle, sweeping motion with your other hand, as if you're 'pushing' the fruit onto the empty cup.
5. **The Reveal:** As you lift the cup with the small object, the fruit appears to be floating above the empty
