Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: "Vanishing Petals"**

**Effect:** A beginner magician makes a bouquet of flowers disappear from their hand, leaving behind only a few scattered petals.

**Materials:**

1. A small bouquet of artificial flowers (you can use silk or paper flowers)
2. A small, empty box or container (e.g., a matchbox or a small tin)
3. A handkerchief or a small piece of cloth
4. A small amount of sticky tape (e.g., duct tape or masking tape)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Before the performance, secretly attach the sticky tape to the underside of the box or container. This will help you to secretly attach the bouquet to the box later.
2. **Show the Bouquet:** Hold the bouquet in your hand and show it to the audience. Make sure they see the flowers and the box.
3. **Cover the Bouquet:** Place the handkerchief or cloth over the bouquet and hold it in place with one hand.
4. **The Secret Move:** With your other hand, quickly attach the bouquet to the underside of the box using the sticky tape. Make sure to do this quickly and smoothly, so the audience doesn't notice.
