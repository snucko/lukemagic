* A willing participant (spectator)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Place the coin in the palm of your dominant hand, with your fingers curled around it. Make sure the coin is secure and won't fall out.
2. **Presentation:** Show the coin to the spectator and explain that you'll make it disappear from your palm.

5. **Handkerchief:** Quickly pick up the handkerchief or small piece of cloth and place it
