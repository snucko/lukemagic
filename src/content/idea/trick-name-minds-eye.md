Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: "Mind's Eye"**

**Materials:**

- A standard deck of 52 playing cards
- A pen or pencil
- A piece of paper for each participant (you can use a notebook or provide pre-printed paper)

**Objective:** To create a trick where the participant thinks of a card, and through the use of a simple drawing technique, you reveal the exact card they're thinking of.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Introduction:** Shuffle the deck and ask a participant to choose a card they'd like to think of. Make sure they keep the card secret.
2. **Drawing Exercise:** Ask the participant to close their eyes and think of their chosen card. Then, ask them to draw a simple picture of the card on the piece of paper provided. This can be as simple as drawing a rectangle with a suit symbol (hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades) in it.
3. **Mirroring:** Take the participant's paper and place it face down on the table. You will then mirror their drawing by creating a simple card shape on a separate piece of paper. For example, if they drew a rectangle with a heart symbol, you would draw a heart-shaped card on your paper.
