Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: "The Vanishing Knot"**

**Materials:**

1. A 3-4 meter long piece of colored string or rope (preferably with a smooth texture)
2. A small clip or a paper clip
3. A handkerchief or a small piece of cloth (optional)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. Begin by holding the string in both hands, with the ends of the string facing away from you.
2. Create a simple knot in the center of the string by folding it over and tucking the end under itself. This will be the knot that you will "vanish."
3. Hold the string in one hand, with the knot facing upwards, and use your other hand to clip the string just above the knot. This will create a small loop.
4. Show the audience the knot and the loop, and then ask them to verify that the knot is still in place.
5. Next, use your hand to cover the knot and the loop, and slowly pass your hand through the loop, as if you are "pushing" the knot through the loop.
6. As you pass your hand through the loop, use your fingers to secretly release the knot from the string. You can do this
