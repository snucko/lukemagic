**Magic Trick: "The Lost Memory"**

**Effect:** A spectator selects a card from a shuffled deck, and then, using a peculiar method, you reveal the exact card they were thinking of before they even chose it.

**Materials:**

1. A standard deck of 52 playing cards
2. A small piece of paper or a sticky note
3. A pen or pencil

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Before the performance, write the numbers 1-52 on the small piece of paper or sticky note. Fold the paper to conceal the numbers.
2. **Introduction:** Shuffle the deck of cards and ask a spectator to select one at random. Make sure they sign their name across the face of the card to ensure it's clearly identifiable as their selection.
3. **The Lost Memory:** Ask the spectator to close their eyes and concentrate on the card they selected. Then, ask them to think of a specific memory associated with that card, such as a person, place, or event.
4. **The Revelation:** Hold the folded paper with the numbers, and without looking at it, ask the spectator to open their eyes and show you the card they selected. Take the card from them and place it on
