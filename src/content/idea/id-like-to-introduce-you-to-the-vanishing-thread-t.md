Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

I'd like to introduce you to "The Vanishing Thread." This trick is a unique, rope-based illusion that's perfect for beginners. It's easy to learn, safe, and requires minimal equipment.

**Materials:**

* A 10-15 foot long piece of colored string or twine (preferably with a bit of texture)
* A small, lightweight object (e.g., a paper clip, a tiny toy, or a small piece of candy)
* A table or other flat surface
* A handkerchief or small cloth (optional)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Tie one end of the string to a stable object, such as a table leg or a ring on the table. Leave a small loop at the top of the string, about 6-8 inches from the tied end.
2. **Introduce the Object:** Place the small object in the loop at the top of the string. Make sure it's secure and won't fall out.
3. **The Routine:** Hold the string in one hand, with the loop facing upwards. Use your other hand to pull the string downwards, so the object is now hanging from the loop.
4. **The Vanish:** Slowly pass the string
