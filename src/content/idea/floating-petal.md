Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: "Floating Petal"**

**Materials:**

1. A small, delicate flower or a artificial flower that can be easily manipulated (e.g., a rose petal or a small carnation).
2. A small, lightweight, and soft cloth (e.g., a silk handkerchief or a piece of gauze).
3. A small, clear plastic container or a glass vial with a lid (e.g., a small jar or a test tube).
4. A small, flat surface (e.g., a table or a tray).

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Place the flower or the artificial flower on the small, flat surface. Cover it with the cloth, making sure it's completely hidden from view.
2. **The Setup:** Hold the clear plastic container or the glass vial in one hand, with the lid slightly ajar. Place the cloth-covered flower on top of the container, making sure it's centered.
3. **The Performance:** Slowly lift the cloth, revealing the flower. As you do this, use your other hand to secretly drop the flower into the container. Make sure to keep the cloth in the way, so the audience doesn't see the flower
