Here's an original mentalism trick for beginners that reads minds and predicts the future.

**Trick Name: "The Timeline Prediction"**

**Materials:**

- A large piece of paper or a whiteboard
- A pen or marker
- A small piece of paper or a sticky note
- A random object (e.g., a pen, a small toy, or a coin)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Before the performance, write down a series of random numbers (e.g., 1-10) on the piece of paper or whiteboard. Fold the paper or cover the numbers with a sticky note so that only you can see them.

2. **The Setup:** Ask a participant to choose a random object from a selection of items (e.g., a pen, a small toy, or a coin). This object will be used as a "key" to unlock the prediction.

3. **The Prediction:** Explain to the participant that you will write down a prediction on the piece of paper or whiteboard. However, you will do it in a way that is not visible to them. Ask the participant to choose a number from the hidden list (1-10) without revealing it to you.
