Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: "The Mysterious Traveler"**

**Materials:**

- A standard deck of 52 playing cards
- A small piece of paper or a sticky note
- A pen or pencil

**Effect:**
The performer asks a spectator to choose a card from the deck and sign their name across it. The card is then placed on top of the deck, and the performer claims that the card has traveled to a specific location in the deck. The spectator is then asked to search for their signed card, and when they find it, they discover that it has moved to a completely different location than where the performer initially claimed.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Before the performance, write a series of numbers (1-5) on the small piece of paper or sticky note. Fold the paper in half and keep it in your pocket or a secure location.

2. **Spectator's Choice:** Shuffle the deck and ask a spectator to choose a card at random. Have them sign their name across the card to ensure it's clearly identifiable as their selection.

3. **Initial Placement:** Place the signed card on top of the deck.

4. **Claiming the Location:** Hold the deck in one hand
