Trick of the day from https://magic.tivnan.net/

**Trick Name: "Lost and Found"**

**Materials:**

- A standard deck of 52 playing cards
- A small piece of paper or a sticky note
- A pen or pencil

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Before the trick, secretly write a number (e.g., 5) on the piece of paper or sticky note. Fold the paper or sticky note and keep it in your pocket or a nearby location where it won't be seen.

2. **The Setup:** Shuffle the deck of cards and ask a spectator to choose a card at random. Have them sign their name across the face of the card to ensure it's clearly identifiable as their selection.

3. **The Performance:** Place the signed card on top of the deck and ask the spectator to hold the deck. Explain that you'll use a special technique to find their signed card.

4. **The "Lost" Phase:** Take the deck from the spectator and ask them to count down to the number written on the piece of paper (in this case, 5). As they count, use your free hand to secretly palm the signed card. The spectator will be focused on counting and won't notice the card being palmed.
