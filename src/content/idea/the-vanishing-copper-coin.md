**Trick Name: "The Vanishing Copper Coin"**

**Materials:**

- 1 copper-colored coin (or any other coin that can be easily palmed)
- A small, lightweight object to use as a distraction (e.g., a small piece of paper, a pen, or a small toy)
- A table or flat surface
- A willing participant (spectator)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:** Before starting the trick, secretly place the copper-colored coin in your dominant hand, making sure it's hidden in your palm. Practice keeping the coin in place without anyone noticing.

2. **The Setup:** Place the small, lightweight object (distraction) on the table in front of you. This will be used to misdirect the spectator's attention.

3. **The Performance:**
   - Hold the distraction object in your non-dominant hand and place it on the table.
   - With your dominant hand, palm the copper-colored coin and place it on top of the distraction object.
   - Use your fingers to cover the coin, making sure it's still hidden in your palm.
   - Say something like, "I'm going to make this coin disappear."
