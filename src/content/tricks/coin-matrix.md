Four coins are placed at the corners of a square formation, each covered by a playing card. One by one, the coins invisibly travel from their positions and gather under a single card, defying logic and physics.

This sophisticated routine showcases advanced sleight of hand techniques while presenting a visual and methodical progression that audiences find mesmerizing. Each phase builds suspense as spectators try to follow the impossible movement of solid metal through space.

The use of playing cards as covers adds theatrical flair while providing perfect misdirection opportunities. Best performed on a close-up mat with proper lighting to emphasize the magical moments.
