A selected card repeatedly rises to the top of the deck despite being buried in the middle. This streamlined version focuses on clear, visual moments that work perfectly for street magic and close-up performances.

The routine builds through several phases, each more impossible than the last, culminating in a surprise kicker ending that leaves audiences completely stunned. Clean handling makes this accessible even for intermediate performers.

Perfect for breaking the ice with new audiences or as a strong opener for longer card routines.
