A spectator freely selects a card from the deck. After the card is noted and returned, it completely vanishes from the deck. The performer then removes their wallet, which has been in plain sight throughout, and inside finds the chosen card sealed in a transparent compartment.

This effect combines the classic "find the card" plot with an impossible location reveal. The fact that the wallet can be examined before and after makes this a powerful closer for any card routine.

The clean handling and minimal setup make this perfect for impromptu performances, requiring only a deck of cards and a simple gimmicked wallet.
