The four aces are dealt into separate piles, each covered by indifferent cards. With just a magical gesture, all four aces invisibly travel and assemble under just one pile, leaving the other three piles empty of aces.

This timeless effect combines precise handling with strong audience engagement. The moment when three piles are revealed to be ordinary cards, followed by the climactic reveal of all four aces in the final pile, never fails to astonish.

Perfect for close-up performances where spectators can examine the cards before and after the effect.
